This github repository contains python scripts to integrate pyslm package with SPPARKS for simulating microstructure evoltuion during laser powder bed fusion. Jupyter-notebooks corresponding to the paper titled [Effect of laser scan rotation on the microstructure and mechanical properties of laser powder bed fused Haynes 282](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2589152923003198) is given here. You are welcome to contribute to the repo. The preprint can be accessed in [SSRN-Preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4379324 ) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369026238_Tailoring_the_Crystallographic_Texture_of_Laser_Powder_Bed_Fused_Haynes_282_Through_Scan_Rotation_Modification_Simulation_Experiments).
