This github repository contains python scripts to integrate pyslm package with SPPARKS for simulating microstructure evoltuion during laser powder bed fusion. Jupyter-notebooks will be uploaded here after the acceptance of the manuscript titled "Tailoring the Crystallographic Texture of Laser Powder Bed Fused Haynes 282 Through Scan Rotation Modification: Simulation & Experiments". At present, the preprint can be accessed in [SSRN-Preprint](http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.4379324 ) and [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369026238_Tailoring_the_Crystallographic_Texture_of_Laser_Powder_Bed_Fused_Haynes_282_Through_Scan_Rotation_Modification_Simulation_Experiments).
